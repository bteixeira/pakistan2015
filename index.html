        <h1>Pakistan 2015</h1>

        <p>
            Ali Ibrahim was getting married in his home city of Lahore, Pakistan, on September 2015, and he invited the
            whole company to attend.
        </p>

        <p>
            A 10 hour flight and a one week stay three time zones away is not something everyone can do on a whim, so
            that left a handful of us who said they might be going. As the date approached, a few more droped out,
            leaving only two of us with the task of seeing Ali successfully married.

            I'm <strong>Bruno Teixeira</strong>, a grumpy wannabe writer from the grumpy country of Portugal, so much
            more grumpy than the others that I actually got fed up and went to live in the grumpy country of Germany. I
            travel for the same reasons as everyone else: supposedly for the learning and experience, but secretly so
            that I have a nice story to tell at parties.
        </p>

        <p>
            My backup is <strong>Christian Kniep</strong>, a man who likes coffee and technology, and doesn't look
            Pakistani at all. He looks classy in a suit but doesn't shy away from adventure and will not think for more
            than three seconds when asked if he wants to climb the Everest tonight. He was born on the north of Germany,
            but in reality he's like Sarkozy driving a Volkswagen: German on the outside and French on the inside.

            <h3>The Arrival</h3>

            <p>
                I landed in Lahore International on the eve of Wednesday. I was on the same flight as Christian but we
                didn't really meet until we were on the ground.
            </p>

            <p>
                One of the first things I saw right off the airplane was a baby wearing make up. Couldn't have been more
                than one year old. She was staring at me from over her mother's shoulder, with her heavy eye liner and
                shade.
            </p>

            <p>
                The wait for the passport control was long. There were many different counters: Pakistan citizens;
                Pakistani citizens living abroad; Saudi Arabian citizens; Special or Disabled persons; Ladies; Diplomat
                foreign citizens; Normal foreign citizens. From the look of the queues, it seemed to be more of a
                suggestion than a rule. When almost all passengers had been processed, a gentleman who was maybe
                involved in airport security directed me to the Ladies' counter, which was empty. A lady with a scarf
                over her head was sitting behind it. She asked what I was doing in Pakistan. She was thrilled to learn
                that I was here to attend a wedding, and she said I was very lucky to have this opportunity, and that
                there would probably be many single beautiful Pakistani women there and that this would be a nice
                opportunity to find a wife. I had been expecting an unfriendly man with a huge beard where his sense of
                humor should be, so I had to laugh, but this still sounded like some sort of trap so I didn't pursue the
                conversation.
