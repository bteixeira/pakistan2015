        <h1>Pakistan 2015</h1>

        <p>
            Ali Ibrahim was getting married in his home city of Lahore, Pakistan, on September 2015, and he invited the
            whole company to attend.
        </p>

        <p>
            A 10 hour flight and a one week stay three time zones away is not something everyone can do on a whim, so
            that left a handful of us who said they might be going. As the date approached, a few more droped out,
            leaving only two of us with the task of seeing Ali successfully married.
        </p>

        <p>
            I'm <strong>Bruno Teixeira</strong>, a grumpy wannabe writer from the grumpy country of Portugal, so much
            more grumpy than the others that I actually got fed up and went to live in the grumpy country of Germany. I
            travel for the same reasons as everyone else: supposedly for the learning and experience, but secretly so
            that I have a nice story to tell at parties.
        </p>

        <p>
            My backup is <strong>Christian Kniep</strong>, a man who likes coffee and technology, and doesn't look
            Pakistani at all. He looks classy in a suit but doesn't shy away from adventure and will not think for more
            than three seconds when asked if he wants to climb the Everest tonight. He was born on the north of Germany,
            but in reality he's like Sarkozy driving a Volkswagen: German on the outside and French on the inside.

            <h3>The Arrival</h3>

            <p>
                I landed in Lahore International on the eve of Wednesday. I was on the same flight as Christian but we
                didn't really meet until we were on the ground.
            </p>

            <p>
                One of the first things I saw right off the airplane was a baby wearing make up. Couldn't have been more
                than one year old. She was staring at me from over her mother's shoulder, with her heavy eye liner and
                shade.
            </p>

            <p>
                The wait for the passport control was long. There were many different counters: Pakistan citizens;
                Pakistani citizens living abroad; Saudi Arabian citizens; Special or Disabled persons; Ladies; Diplomat
                foreign citizens; Normal foreign citizens. From the look of the queues, it seemed to be more of a
                suggestion than a rule. When almost all passengers had been processed, a gentleman who was maybe
                involved in airport security directed me to the Ladies' counter, which was empty. A lady with a scarf
                over her head was sitting behind it. She asked what I was doing in Pakistan. She was thrilled to learn
                that I was here to attend a wedding, and she said I was very lucky to have this opportunity, and that
                there would probably be many single beautiful Pakistani women there and that this would be a nice
                opportunity to find a wife. I had been expecting an unfriendly man with a huge beard where his sense of
                humor should be, so I had to laugh, but this still sounded like some sort of trap so I didn't pursue the
                conversation.
            </p>

            <p>
                After I was processed, Christian went to the same counter. The lady was pleased to learn that he was here for a wedding and said he was very lucky and there would be a lot of girls there.
            </p>

            <p>
                We collected our bags in a couple of minutes. We looked for the customs process where we would have to declare our 2.0 bottles of alcohol each. Before we could find it, a thin man found us and applied this exhaustive procedure: he took the luggage number on my boarding pass; he compared it to the number on the luggage; that's it. We went outside.
            </p>

            <p>
                Ali and his cousin Asi were waiting for us, and so were thousands of other people.
            </p>

            <p>
                We couldn't go directly to the hotel because it was 5:00 and we couldn't check in before 7:00. We took a night city tour. We went to have beans and bread and lassi for breakfast. The four of us paid â‚¬ 3.00
            </p>

            <p>
                I tried four ATMs before I found one that worked and accepted my card. This never happened to me in any country before. We finally checked in and slept some 5 hours.
            </p>

            <h3>The Rehearsal</h3>

            <p>
                Ali and Jawad picked us up and took us for lunch. We were stopped by the army on the way. It seems there is an area called CANTT in the city which is used by the army, so special security measures are enforced when approaching these areas.
            </p>

            <p>
                Because they realized we were foreigners, they had us provide our passports and put our fingerprints on a <em>notebook</em> next to our names and passport numbers. I don't think they would be able to do something with that information even if they meant to.
            </p>

            <p>
                We got on our way. Why the army is housed in the center of major cities and not outside, I have no idea.
            </p>

            <p>
                We got to a restaurant. There was a blackout while we were eating. There seems to be a blackout every couple of hours or so. There was one just now as I finished writing that sentence. They seem to be scheduled at specific times of the day. They last from a couple of seconds to about half a minute.
            </p>

            <p>
                The restaurant had a generator. There are generators in most places.
            </p>

            <p>
                There was also a metal detector at the entrance of the restaurant, as there was at one of the entrances of the Gymkhana Hotel. Security guards at the Gymkhana gates carry openly displayed shotguns, even if security seems pretty relaxed. I still don't understand what the security sittuation is around here. On one hand, it seems that never happens, on the other it seems that everybody always expects the worst. A highly rigid society kept in place by the show of firepower. A saloon full of cowboys sitting quietly all eyeing each other ready to draw their guns. I really don't know how safe or worried I should feel. Is it possible that all this militarization only makes people nervous and therefore justifies itself simply by existing? Or would everything quickly devolve into chaos if security measures were relaxed? Ali says there was some incident at a school last December. He talked of it as if I should probably know what he was talking about. Ever since then, all schools and colleges have barbed wire running through the whole length of their 2m+ tall walls, which me and Christian could see by ourselves.
            </p>

            <p>
                We went to Ali's house. A few children started showing up, cousins and nephews of Ali's. The houses next to Ali's belong to close relatives of his. This day is supposed to be some sort of rehearsal for the day after. Young people, mostly single young men, will dance in front of the crowd, with equal parts of choreography taken from movies and improvisation.
            </p>

            <p>
                Ali's brother Ahsan offered to take us on a tour of the city along with Jawad. We saw a lot of new avenues, the fanciest of which was named after a famous pilot of the 1965 war with India. Ahsan also took us to the Polo club, of which he is a member. Ahsan owns an event management company and is also a member of the Gymkhana Club, and it was him who managed to host us there.
            </p>

            <p>
                You have to wait 8 or 10 years to be a member of the club. The Polo Club seems equally exclusive. He could join because his wife's family owns enough horses to form a team.
            </p>

            <p>
                While describing which colleges and universities would receive which level of the jetset, he explained that each city in Pakistan has a "circle". He said that once you are in the circle, you are in, and you start frequenting social events with the same people constantly. It takes a lot of networking and knowing the right people in order to be "in the circle". There is a group of about 2000 people, and you will start socializing invariably with people from this group. Unlike what it looks like on the outside, Lahore is teeming with underground parties and other social events, where, he emphasized, anything is possible, implying maybe even things not allowed by Islam. Life is never boring if you are in the circle.
            </p>

            <p>
                We go back to Ali's place and there were more people there. There were about 10 boys probably in their early twenties. They dance well-known choreographies in front of a crowd of mostly women. Christian was both eager and reluctant to join in. I was just reluctant. He eventually joined in and after Ahsan basically forced me to do the same. We gave quite a show with our western don't-move-very-much style, with all the boys behind us trying to keep up. They were just moving too much.
            </p>

            <p>
                I had noticed before that there were a couple of boys who didn't seem to fit the group. They were going back and forth with drinks and other chores. They were dressed in black and when they tried talking to us it became apparent that neither spoke English.
            </p>

            <p>
                It took me a while to realize that they were not two of Ali's cousins chosen to help with the event, but the permanent house servants. Maham had told me about servants when I met her back in Berlin; I just didn't expect them to be so young. Apart from the two boys there was at least a girl and possibly a fourth servant.
            </p>

            <p>
                The whole deal with the servants feels weird. Since I don't speak Urdu I don't know how amicable people are to them, but there seemed to be a clear master-servant relationship in place. When me and Christian asked where we could put our empty dinner plates, Ahsan said, by all means, give them to me, and he proceeded to summon the boy in a strict voice. Again, I don't speak Urdu, but if I had to guess, Ahsan's speech sounded like "why haven't you taken their dishes yet?"
            </p>

            <p>
                So night proceeded with boys eagerly showing off their dancing skills, me and Christian reluctantly showing our lack thereof, eating dinner with our hands and meeting various members of the family. We had been told the rule was a handshake for men, and absolutely no touching for women. So meeting guys was as straight forward as would have been in Europe, and meeting women was always an awkward standing up, nodding and saying "nice to meet you" too many times. Sometimes we managed to come up with a couple of sentences about how it was nice to be in Pakistan.
            </p>

            <p>
                As the dancing died out, and after some of the girls had their turn, there was a moment when we were all sitting around one kid with a guitar, singing. Ali signaled one of the servant boys and pointed to the ground next to him. For one second it seemed that Ali was having a nice gesture of having the boy join us for a while. Only then did I realize he was pointing at some empty glasses that needed to be taken away.
            </p>

            <p>
                The last part of the night was something we had been "promised" at the start of the day: we were going to help prepare the gift boxes for the guests, with some nuts and sweets inside. As one of Ali's sisters started explaining everybody the whole process, me and the German had the same idea at the same time: let's make an assembly line. Eyes shined and approvals came from the crowd. It took a few finished products but the self-tuned to a very efficient procedure. Jawad would receive the boxes with only dates, do his part, pass them to me, who would pass them to Chris who would pass them to Ali and his cousins who would close the boxes and align them neatly. The two wannabe Germans, me and Chris, took the task very seriously and enjoyed it very much, making constant optimizations to the process. Parallel execution, out-of-order execution and branch prediction were just a few. When all the nuts had been exhausted, we said goodbye and Jawad dropped us at the hotel.
